# Train Controller (Joystick emulation) for Arduino Leonardo
Quick note: I will soon be updating this repository again, hopefully allowing for a great amount of modularity in what to connect. This is useful for both building your own sim and for me when I decide to change up the current build.

My own train simulator controller software for use with an Arduino Leonardo or Leonardo clones on Train Simulator classic AKA Railworks 3. Build your own cab for cheap.

What you need to get started:
- Arduino Leonardo or Leonardo clones (other arduinos might work if they have analog inputs and usb HID device emulation too, but I can NOT guarantee that they will work)
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Arduino Joystick library (https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/releases)
- Raildriver joystick interface to rebind the arduino inputs to actual movements and buttons in-game (https://simtogether.com/files/file/929-raildriver-and-joystick-interface/) It is recommended that you download the file called '471270362_TS2017RaildriverandJoystickInterfaceV3.2.9.zip' as that is the newest. In that zip archive you will find a secondary zip called 'TS2017 Raildriver and Joystick Interface V3.2.9.zip' Unzip that too. After unzipping both of those you will find 'TS2019 Interface (x64).exe' use that if you are using the 64-bit version or use 'TS2019 Interface (x86).exe' if you are using the 32-bit version of Train Simulator.
- Potentiometers & buttons (the amount of each depends on what kind of setup you will use)
- Wires
- Breadboard(s) for testing
- Some (basic) coding knowledge
- Bonus: Soldering iron and 3D printer so you don't just turn potentiometers by hand
- And lastly, some patience for setting this up. (Trust me, it is worth it if you enjoy train sim - which, let's be honest, you probably do considering you are here ðŸ™‚)

If you have questions or need help, please do not use the bugtracker for that. I will be setting up the wiki and a discord server if there is demand for it (For now you can use the bugtracker if you really need to, but classify it as a question please).

I am by no means the most professional or efficient coder, I know that! But any feedback or code suggestions on how to do things more efficiently or your own contributions/spin-offs are always welcome!

You can go to the wiki for a quick and simple how to (WIP)
